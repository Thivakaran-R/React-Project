# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# React Toggle Theme Component

This is a simple React component that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes. It stores the user's theme preference in `localStorage` so that the chosen theme persists across sessions.

## Features

- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Saves the user's theme preference in `localStorage`, ensuring the theme persists even after a page reload or revisit.
- **Dynamic Theme Switch**: Users can toggle between dark and light themes by clicking a button.
- **Responsive UI**: The component dynamically updates the UI to reflect the current theme, displaying the active theme in the heading and button.
